# **What is the IOTA development fund?**

**IOTA Foundation helps you and other developers get new innovation and ideas off the ground**

The IOTA Foundation funds new innovation from developers considered beneficial for the overall IOTA ecosystem. Ideas can be from proof-of-concepts to utilities, libraries, and more. Everyone who requires financial support in the broader IOTA developer community can be encouraged to develop, collaborate, learn, inspire and build for the greater good.

**How are the development grants funded?**

**The development fund has been created from a unique model of community donations**

Members in the IOTA community proposed the establishment of a fund to support the effort and unique innovation it takes to build a thriving IOTA Ecosystem. With generous donations from many community members, over 20 Tera IOTA were raised. These funds have the potential to empower the Ecosystem for years to come.

**Why should I apply?**

**Enable your technology vision to become reality through funding and support**

The IOTA Foundation understands that in order to foster, propel and sustain a great Ecosystem, significant resources are required.\
\
Some of our community members may be looking to make a difference through part-time contributions, or perhaps have become stuck through lack of time and resources. Neither the Foundation nor community want to see these ideas go to waste.\
\
Supporting these types of initiatives with development both large and small, the fund is powering the IOTA Ecosystem as a long-lasting and powerful hub around the IOTA core technology.

Each submission must provide a thorough explanation of the concept, supported by relevant documentation, and is then assessed upon individual merit.
